Analysis Mindset Elementary Student using Google Colab

## 📌 Overview

Indonesia has set a national vision to improve the quality of its human resources (SDM) under the slogan **"Indonesia Emas 2045"**, aiming to become a developed and competitive nation by its centennial. One of the key foundations to achieve this goal lies in strengthening the education sector, particularly by cultivating a positive and growth-oriented mindset among students from an early age.

In this project, I conducted an analysis of elementary school students' mindsets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The data was collected through questionnaires and processed using **Google Colab**, integrating tools such as **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API** for seamless data handling and automation.

## 📁 Dataset

Unfortunately, i was unable to upload my JSON credentials from my Google Cloud due security concerns. Thats why, i have uploaded 4 dataset file from Kelas 5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D, which contains responses from 92 students.
